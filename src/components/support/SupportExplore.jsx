      <h1> Is there a minimum to invest in crypto?</h1>

      <p className='text-sm text-gray font-medium'>Anyone can invest in crypto, and exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini make it accessible to invest in coins with the change in your pocket. However, if you are looking to professionally invest your capital in crypto with the worldâ€™s leading crypto investors you will need a much bigger check, with entry into a lot of funds requiring a minimum investment of $250K or more. Yieldstreet removes this barrier to entry and allows you to invest alongside professional crypto investors with as little as $25K.</p>
